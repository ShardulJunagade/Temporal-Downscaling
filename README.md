### Temporal Downscaling Challenge

Climate and hydrological models often produce coarse-resolution outputs (e.g., monthly or yearly data), which are insufficient for applications requiring high-frequency insights, such as flood forecasting, urban water management, and climate adaptation. This challenge invites participants to develop machine learning (ML) or statistical approaches to **downscale coarse-resolution time series data (e.g., monthly rainfall, temperature, or river discharge)** into **high-resolution daily or hourly data** for enhanced civil and environmental engineering decision-making.

#### Objectives
- Develop a method to predict **finer-resolution (daily/hourly) values** from coarse data.
- Evaluate model performance using statistical and physical consistency metrics.
- Apply the downscaled data to real-world applications such as hydrology, disaster management, and climate modelling.

#### Challenge Details

**A. Provided Dataset**
1. **Coarse-resolution time series data** (e.g., monthly climate or hydrological variables).
2. **Observed high-resolution (daily/hourly) data** for validation.
3. Additional environmental parameters such as elevation, humidity, and wind speed (optional).

**B. Expected Solution Approaches**  
Participants may use one or a combination of the following techniques:

1. **Traditional Statistical Downscaling**
   - Linear interpolation methods
   - Multiple regression models
   - Wavelet transform for multi-scale decomposition

2. **Machine Learning-Based Downscaling**
   - Random Forest, XGBoost, or Support Vector Regression (SVR)
   - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as LSTM/GRU
   - Gaussian Processes for Probabilistic Predictions

3. **Deep Learning Super-Resolution for Time Series**
   - Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)
   - Transformer-based models for time series forecasting
   - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for realistic high-frequency data

**Evaluation Criteria**

| Metric                        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) | Measures predictive power (closer to 1 is better)                          |
| Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)  | Lower values indicate better accuracy                                      |
| Mean Absolute Error (MAE)      | Measures absolute prediction error                                         |
| Physical Consistency           | Does the predicted time series maintain realistic hydrological/climatic behaviour? |

**Bonus Considerations**
- Interpretability: Clear explanation of model behaviour.
- Generalizability: Ability to apply the model to different datasets.
- Computational Efficiency: Feasibility of real-time deployment.
